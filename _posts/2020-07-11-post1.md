I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto, and this is my personal website andblog for all things ecology, evolution, and the philosophy of science. I will also branch out to topics outside of just research or academia: the personal is political and experiences should be expressed. Given the demands of graduate school and research, I will update and add posts when I have (or make) the time.
