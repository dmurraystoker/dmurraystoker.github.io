# Urban Ecology & Evolution

## Ecological consequences of urbanization a legume-rhizobia mutualism

![](../assets/images/clover_lab_2018.jpg){: .align-left} 

Mutualisms between plants and microbes are critical for community development and ecosystem structure and function. One example of a plant-microbial mutualism is between legumes and rhizobia, whereby legumes provides photosynthate and nodule habitat to rhizobia in return for nitrogen (N) fixed by the rhizobia. For my thesis research, I am using the mutualism between white clover (_Trifolium repens_) and its primary rhizobial symbiont, _Rhizobium leguminosarum_ biovar _trifolii_, to study how urbanization affects the ecology and evolution of mutualisms.

## Microbiome assembly in urban environments

Urbanization can drive spatial variation in soil chemistry and nutrients, which can affect the assembly and composition of soil microbial communities. As plant microbiome assembly is ultimately determined by the microbes present in the local soil community, changes to soil microbial composition can affect plant microbiome assembly and function. Notwithstanding growing research into microbiomes, there is limited evidence demonstrating how microbiome assembly and diversity varies within and among natural populations of the same host. This project will begin to fill the gap by quantifying the urban-driven changes to microbiome structure. For my thesis research, I sampled white clover, rhizobia, and soil along an urbanization gradient in the Greater Toronto Area, ON, Canada to (1) evaluate how microbiome composition varies among soil and root compartments and (2) identify the underlying drivers of microbiome assembly and composition. I am in the process of extracting DNA and preparing samples for sequencing by the end of 2021, and analyzing data and communicating the results in 2022.

## (Co)Evolutionary ecology of microbiomes in the urban mosaic

Bacteria and fungi comprising the microbiome are important for plant community assembly, physiology, and response to stressors. As bacteria and fungi can have different functional roles relative to rhizobia, the function of the root microbiome is a multifaceted and emergent property of the ecological roles played by rhizobia, bacteria, and fungi. Alterations to microbiome structure could therefore strongly impact plant communities and associated ecosystem functions. Using a manipulative experimental, I am asking (1) are white clover and microbiomes locally adapted? And (2) does N addition mediate any effects of local adaptation?  

For this experiment, I am using 30 populations of white clover from an urbanization gradient in the Greater Toronto Area, ON, Canada. Each population is crossed with three microbiome (home, away-rural, and away-urban) and two nitrogen (10 mM KNO<sub>3</sub>, ambient N) treatments, with 6 replicates for each treatment combinations (1080 total plants). At the end of the experiment, I will measure plant and rhizobia variables related performance and fitness. I will also sequence a subset of samples to compare microbiome composition and diversity across populations and treatments. I hope to eventually extend this work to evaluate the community- and ecosystem-level feedbacks in the white clover-rhizobia mutualism.

# (Meta)Community Ecology

## Community assembly and diversity

![](../assets/images/stream_HE1_riffle.jpg){: .align-left} 

A fundamental question in community ecology is: what drives community assembly? This is not an easy question to answer, as communities are the result of the dynamic interplay between local and regional factors. I am currently working with my partner and fellow researcher Kelly Murray-Stoker to address this question. We are using publicly-available data collected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate metacommunity structure and the environmental, landscape, and network variables that best predict realized assemblages at the macroecological scale. We have found that communities can display [consistent metacommunity typologies despite varying drivers of assembly](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.13220). Future work will go beyond the [elements of metacommunity structure](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970210.x) and the [paradigm of metacommunity typology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00608.x) frameworks to (1) test and compare models of community assembly (2) understand community assembly across taxonomic groups and freshwater ecosystem types at the macroecological scale.  

I am also interested in patterns and drivers of diversity, taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic. Working with collaborators on open datasets, I want to quantify functional trait diversity of river and stream communities and to identify predictors of trait diversity across spatial scales. Additionally, I want to examine how communities and associated functional diversity respond to disturbance and environmental change at local, regional, and macroecological scales.

## Niches and community equilibrium

Understanding and predicting community responses to environmental change are essential components of community ecology. Evaluating how community composition relates to the niche of organisms comprising the community is one way to measure the effect of environmental filtering and niche matching towards community equilibrium. Through the [framework of disequilibrium theory](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/14-0589.1) or DisEQ, I am working with collaborators to (1) investigate spatial variation in environmental filtering and niche mismatch and (2) use DisEQ-by-trait and trait-by-environment relationships to derive a mechanistic understanding of how environmental change could affect environmental and niche mismatch.
