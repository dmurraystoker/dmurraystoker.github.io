I am a supporter of open science. Transparency, open-access software, and distribution of data is essential to meet the demands of modern ecological research. It also increases integrity, reproducibility, and our ability to maintain collaborative efforts. I mainatin my research projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/dmurraystoker). I aim to provide information regarding research questions, hypotheses and predictions, methods, and statistical analyses in a transparent and reproducible manner. I will also provide data for all projects whenever possible.
