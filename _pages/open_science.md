I am a supporter of open science. Transparency, open-access software, and distribution of data is essential to meet the demands of modern ecological research. It also increases integrity, reproducibility, and our ability to maintain collaborative efforts. I concurrently manage and mainatin my research projects on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/9chg5/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/dmurraystoker). I aim to provide information regarding research questions, hypotheses and predictions, methods, and statistical analyses. I will also provide data for all projects whenever possible.
